    "# Transient 1D Wave Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to set up a transient simulation with partial updates. This is illustrated with a simple simulation of a wave propagating with a velocity of 1m/s and a damping coefficient of 0.5 1/s. The domain is 2m long with the end at x = 0m fixed and the end at x = 2m free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wave equation with damping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - b \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be solved with 4th order accuracy for the second derivatives and fifth order for the damping term so that the number of coefficients match in the approximation of the time derivative. The domain (x) is discretized by 5 terms while time is discretized with a backwards approximation with 6 terms.\n",

    "Terms above the line in the stencil are solved for each time step. The terms below the line are static. As a result, the terms above the line end up in the model coefficient matrix while the static coefficients below the line are put in the constraint vector.\n",

    "v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u^t}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2 u^t}{\\partial t^2} - b \\frac{\\partial u^t}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{t-n}}{\\partial t^2} + b \\frac{\\partial u^{t-n}}{\\partial t}\n",
